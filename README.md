# Twitter Data Sentiment Analysis Project

Analyze sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards entities using TextBlob. The project includes data preprocessing, validation against labeled sentiments, and visualization of sentiment distributions to gain insights into sentiment trends.

## Project Overview

This project processes Twitter data to identify and analyze sentiment patterns. The goal is to extract sentiment from tweets, validate predictions with labeled sentiments, and visualize the sentiment trends for entities.

**Features**:

- **Entity**: The subject of the tweet.
- **Text**: The tweet content.
- **Sentiment**: Labeled sentiment of the tweet (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Irrelevant).

**Target**: Understanding public sentiment and its alignment with labeled data.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, TextBlob
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Lab
- **Techniques**: Text preprocessing (removal of stopwords, tokenization, lemmatization), sentiment validation, and visualization.

## Results

  - Sentiment distribution across entities.
  - Overall sentiment trends in the data.
